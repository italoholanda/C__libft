# Libft
In this project, I recoded some functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions.

## Content

- **Part 01:** In this first part, I re-coded a set of libc functions as defined in your `man`. The functions have the same prototype and behavior as the originals <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi">(BSD).</a>

- **Part 02:** In this second part, I coded a set of functions that are not included in libc or are included in a different form.

## Part 01

### String manipulation functions

<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="">**strchr**</a>
	</li>
</ul>
